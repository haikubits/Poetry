In night's embrace, the moon does crown,<br>
The feline's watch, in shadows drown.<br>
A tapestry of silver light,<br>
The tree's arms cradle the night.


Gnarled limbs stretch with stories bold,<br>
Against the moon's soft, glowing hold.<br>
Crimson leaves whisper autumn's cry,<br>
A quiet scene beneath the sky.


The sentinel in calm repose,<br>
While tranquil light around it flows.<br>
Behold the night's serene parade,<br>
Where light and dark are softly swayed.<br>
