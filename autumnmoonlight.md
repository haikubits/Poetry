In night's embrace, the moon does crown,

The feline's watch, in shadows drown.

A tapestry of silver light,

The tree's arms cradle the night.


Gnarled limbs stretch with stories bold,

Against the moon's soft, glowing hold.

Crimson leaves whisper autumn's cry,

A quiet scene beneath the sky.


The sentinel in calm repose,

While tranquil light around it flows.

Behold the night's serene parade,

Where light and dark are softly swayed.
